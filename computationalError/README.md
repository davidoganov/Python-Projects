 S&S:  Module 5.2, Project 7
 The program calculates the absolute and relative errors for the points in Module 2.2, Exercise 8a-d 
 and display those values to the console. The program also plots out a line plot which shows the
 calculated value of the investment versus time superimposed with the analytical value.
 
 S&S: Module 5.2, Project 7:
 Develop a system dynamics model for Exercise 8 in Module 2.2, “Unconstrained
 Growth and Decay.” Have your system dynamics tool calculate the
 absolute and relative errors of the simulated values in comparison to the analytical
 values.
 
 Points in Module 2.2, Exercise 8a-d:
 Suppose an investment has approximately a continuous growth rate of 9.3%.
 Calculate analytically the value of an initial investment of $500 after
 a. 10 yr 
 b. 20 yr 
 c. 30 yr 
 d. 40 yr
